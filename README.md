# St. Max Technology

## Overview

In this day and age most kids are exposed to technology at an early age and develop and intuitive grasp for how phones, tablets, computers, and the internet work.  While it is important to solidify the foundation skills to computer usage within the classroom, time should also be spend on understanding how computers work and on developing good habits about computer usage.  The latter point is of extremely high importance from a Catholic standpoint!  With established tools like the internet and new tools like ChatGPT, there is a lot to navigate!  My goal is to focus on the following broad topics to build those foundation skills, help inspire wonder in our students, and encourage responsible usage:

* Learn important skills

* Understand how technology works

* Understand how to use technology appropriately


## Curriculum 

To build out a quality curriculum I am pulling from a number of quality resources:

* [Common Sense Media]()

* [Scratch]()

In addition I am pulling from my own experience as a software developer.
